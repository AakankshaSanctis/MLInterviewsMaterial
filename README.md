Some companies have a live ML coding round or a take home assignment. You can practice these kaggle competitions to get some hands-on experience.
Some beginner Kaggle competitions have been listed here: https://www.kaggle.com/getting-started/78482. This includes Classification, Regression, Computer vision and NLP competitions.

In all of these challenges, data exploration is a must-have skill. If you are rusty with data exploration, try running this notebook on your own: https://www.kaggle.com/code/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python/notebook

Some good notebooks and blogs which go through these competitions:
