# ML Interviews Material


## Coding/Data Structures
For practising coding questions related to data structures and algorithms, the best resource is Leetcode. To quickly build up your coding prowess, follow quides such as 
* [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75)
  * The author of this list has written an excellent book on approaching technical interviews called the [Technical Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/). Do go through the [algorithms cheatsheet](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/) to get an idea of the common patterns in interview problems.
* [Neetcode RoadMap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)
  * If you find yourself stuck on any problem, Neetcode's [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLlXCFG5TnA&list=PLot-Xpze53ldVwtstag2TL4HQhAnC8ATf&ab_channel=NeetCode) is a goldmine which simplifies a lot of problems
* Another good resource for praticing questions are the company focussed list on leetcode. Though this is available only for premium users, some of them are published on [github](https://github.com/snehasishroy/leetcode-companywise-interview-questions)

## ML Breadth
* This interview is intended to evaluate your general knowledge of ML concepts both from theoretical and practical perspectives.
For a detailed overview of Machine Learning, go through the [Stanford's ML course (CS229) notes](https://cs229.stanford.edu/lectures-spring2022/main_notes.pdf) 

* For some quick revision, you can go through some very well compiled cheatsheets for ML: https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms-cheat-sheet-2f01d1d3aa37

* For interview focussed prep, Chip Huyen's [Machine Learning interview book](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/) is a golden resource. She has compiled commonly asked questions in ML interviews which in themselves are great for revising ML concepts. I am attempted to answer some of the questions from this book for reference.

* For ML concepts, a quick revision playlist is Victor Lavrenko's [Applied Machine Learning class](https://www.youtube.com/@vlavrenko/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=10).



## ML system design

## ML coding

Some companies have a live ML coding round or a take home assignment. You can practice these kaggle competitions to get some hands-on experience.
Some beginner Kaggle competitions have been listed here: https://www.kaggle.com/getting-started/78482. This includes Classification, Regression, Computer vision and NLP competitions.

In all of these challenges, data exploration is a must-have skill. If you are rusty with data exploration, try running this notebook on your own: https://www.kaggle.com/code/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python/notebook

Some good notebooks and blogs which go through these competitions:
